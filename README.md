### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, I'm Lucas!

I'm 19 years old, I'm a systems analysis and development student, in my 3rd semester at Unisinos.

My desire to work with technology emerged around 2020 when I was 15/16 years old. I always liked having challenges, playing video games and my life was aligned with sport where I learned to win and lose and be better every day.

In 2020, I started studying web development and doing some freelancing, I got website support to help and I fell in love with this world. When I completed technical high school in 2022, I decided that I wanted to study to be a developer and really pursue my career in technology.

From then on, I took some courses, entered college, worked for a year and a half at HT Micron Semiconductors where I had experience with IT Infrastructure and internal customer service and grew a lot professionally.

Now, I'm working as a freelance developer (PJ) developing websites and web applications. I go to college, I do some personal projects and I also really like the backend, I believe I will want to be a full-stack developer.

I will continue to seek to always improve my knowledge, seek challenges that take me out of my comfort zone and work to help organizations with technology.
