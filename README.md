### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, my name is Lucas!

I'm 19 years old, I'm a systems analysis and development student, I'm in my 3rd semester at Unisinos.

My desire to work with technology came around 2020, when I was 15/16 years old. I have always liked challenges, playing video games and my life was aligned with sport where I learned to win and lose and to be better every day.

In 2020 I started studying web development and freelancing, I got website support to help and I fell in love with this world. When I finished technical high school in 2022, I decided that I wanted to study to be a developer and really pursue a career in technology.

From then on, I took some courses, entered college, worked for a year and a half at HT Micron Semiconductors where I had experience with IT Infrastructure and internal customer service and grew a lot professionally.

Now I have a software company that develops websites and web applications.

I will continue to always seek to improve my knowledge, seek challenges that take me out of my comfort zone and work to help organizations with technology.
